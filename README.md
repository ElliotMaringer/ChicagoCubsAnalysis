# Chicago Cubs 2025 Season Analysis

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Chicago Cubs' 2025 season performance, with a particular focus on the dramatic shift in team success before and after the All-Star break. The analysis uses team-level and player-level statistics to understand why a once-promising team has started to collapse late in the season.

## Project Overview

After a red-hot start to the 2025 season, the Cubs entered the All-Star break as one of the best teams in baseball. However, in the second half of the season, the team experienced a significant decline in performance â€” especially in offensive production. This project explores:

- Team win-loss trends
- Offensive statistics before and after the All-Star break
- Key monthly performance trends
- Player-specific breakdowns of Pete Crow-Armstrong, Kyle Tucker, and Seiya Suzuki

## Key Findings

- **Games Above .500 Trend**: The Cubs steadily climbed above .500 until the All-Star break, then plateaued and declined.
- **Team Offense**: Batting average, OPS, and runs per game all dropped significantly in the second half.
- **Player Drop-Offs**:
  - **Pete Crow-Armstrong**: Power and RBI production fell sharply; strikeouts increased significantly.
  - **Kyle Tucker**: Notable drop in HRs, RBIs, and OBP after a strong start.
  - **Seiya Suzuki**: Slugging percentage and run production collapsed early in the second half, though showed slight recovery in August.

## Methods & Tools

- **Language**: R
- **Environment**: RStudio
- **Data Manipulation**: dplyr, tidyverse
- **Visualization**: ggplot2, scales
- **Document Format**: RMarkdown (.Rmd) rendered to Word Document
